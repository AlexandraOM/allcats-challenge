This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

# üêà allplants coding challenge!

Hey there pal! Your task as an allstar engineer is to create a web application for our new digital product - ALLCATS - a cat adoption service! You've been supplied the following assets from our UX team:

- [Wireframes](/wireframe) for [desktop](wireframe/Desktop.jpg) and [mobile](wireframe/Mobile.jpg)
- [SVG assets](https://github.com/allplants/challenge/tree/master/assets)

As well as the following brand guidelines:

- Primary colour: #2EA372
- Background colour: #E7E7E7
- Font: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)

We'd love you to show us your skills and spend some time building as much of the application as you can. You can use any framework and libraries that you like, so feel free to experiment and have a play.

As the rest of our engineering team are hard at work building the API service, here's a mock endpoint which returns some data test you can use to enable us to start work on building the prototype: [https://5e5932cd7777050014463360.mockapi.io/cats](https://5e5932cd7777050014463360.mockapi.io/cats)

### Bonus points

Here's some extra things you could ponder about. Don't worry if you don't understand or have no idea about how to do any of them! If you run out of time but have ideas on how you _would_ going about tackling these, jot down your ideas in the readme file as part of your submission.

- How could you build the "best" badge functionality using the `"tag"` field in the mock endpoint?
- We like clean and easy to read code! Try to use ES6 syntax and features as much as possible
- What about including some delightful user interactions (how would the button behave when you click it? What about hover states?)
- Can you host your completed application somewhere?
- What kind of unit tests could you write?
- Loading / error / fail states? What if our API service was down? How might we communicate this to our user?
- Accessibility?
- Scaling - what if we had 1000 cats to rehome?!?! How could we build our application to support this?

### Submission

Please submit your work as a Github repository or a .zip file. Include a readme file with instructions of how we can get your codebase up and running, and any other additional information you think we may need.

Please let us know if you have any questions or are unsure about how to approach it. Good luck and have fun!
